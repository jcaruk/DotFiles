A friend and I were discussing how I have never been satisfied with other
dotfiles people have published. Rather, I read a selection of them and use them
as templates to base mine own off of. She asked why I hadn't made a repository
for mine yet.

I hope that these files may be useful to others (whether they use my versions,
or just use them as references)!
