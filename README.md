Purpose
====================
The purpose of this repository is to force me to tidy up my configuration files. Beyond that, having them all in one place I can access from anywhere would be super helpful.

I have never been satisfied with other dotfiles people have published. I read a selection of them and used them as templates to base my own off of.

I hope that these files may be useful to others (whether they use my versions, or just use them as references)!
